Topics covered include matched filtering and pulse compression; optimum predetection processing; the radar ambiguity function; and the linear frequency modulation waveform and matched filter. Parameter estimation and discrete coded waveforms are also discussed, along with the effects of distortion on matched-filter signals. This book is comprised of 14 chapters and begins with an overview of the concepts and techniques of pulse compression matched filtering, with emphasis on coding source and decoding device. The discussion then turns to the derivation of the matched-filter properties in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio; analysis of radar ambiguity function using the principle of stationary phase; parameter estimation and the method of maximum likelihood; and measurement accuracies of matched-filter radar signals. Waveform design criteria for multiple and dense target environments are also considered. The final chapter describes a number of techniques for designing microwave dispersive delays. This monograph will be a useful resource for graduate students and practicing engineers in the field of radar system engineering.},

  abstract = {Acoustic methods used in fish abundance estimation constitute a key part of the analytic assessment that makes the basis for abundance estimation of marine resources. The methods rely on power-budget equations and calibrated systems. Different formulations of power-budget equations and calibration factors have been proposed for use in scientific echo sounder and sonar systems. There are unresolved questions and apparent inconsistencies in prior literature related to this field. A generic (instrument independent) and unifying theory is presented that attempts to explain the different power-budget and calibration factor formulations proposed and used in prior literature, and how these are mutually related. Deviations and apparent inconsistencies in this literature appear to be explained and corrected. This also includes different (instrument specific) formulations employed in important modern scientific echo sounder systems, and their relationship to the generic theory of abundance estimation. Prior literature is extended to provide more complete power-budget equations for fish abundance estimation and species identification, by accounting for echo integration, electrical termination, and the full range of electrical and acoustical echo sounder parameters. The expressions provide a consistent theoretical basis for improved understanding of conventional methods and instruments used today, also enabling improved sensitivity and error analyses, and correction possibilities.},

  abstract = {A new radar technique has been developed that provides a solution for the conflicting requirements of simultaneous long-range and high-resolution performance in radar systems. This technique, called Chirp at Bell Telephone Laboratories, recognizes that resolution depends on the transmitted pulse bandwidth. A long high-duty-factor transmitted pulse, with suitable modulation (linear frequency modulation in the case of Chirp), which covers a frequency interval many times the inherent bandwidth of the envelope, is employed. The receiver is designed to make optimum use of the additional signal bandwidth. This paper contains many of the important analytical methods required for the design of a Chirp radar system. The details of two signal generation methods are considered and the resulting signal waveforms and power spectra are calculated. The required receiver characteristics are derived and the receiver output waveforms are presented. The time-bandwidth product is introduced and related to the effective increase in the performance of Chirp systems. The concept of a matched filler is presented and used as a reference standard in receiver design. The effect of amplitude and phase distortion is analyzed by the method of paired echoes. One consequence of the signal design is the presence of time side lobes on the receiver output pulse analogous to the spatial side lobes in antenna theory. A method to reduce the time side lobes by weighting the pulse energy spectrum is explained in terms of paired echoes. The weighting process is described, and calculated pulse envelopes, weighting network characteristics and dele-???},

	abstract = {Norwegian spring-spawning herring are a critical economic resource for multiple nations in the North Atlantic and a keystone species of the Nordic Seas ecosystem. Given the wide areas that the herring occupy, it is difficult to accurately measure the population size and spatial distribution. Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (OAWRS) was used to instantaneously measure the areal population density of Norwegian herring over more than one thousand square kilometers in spawning grounds near Ålesund, Norway. In the vicinity of the Ålesund trench near peak spawning, significant attenuation in signal-to-noise ratio and mean sensing range was observed after nautical sunset that had not been observed in previous OAWRS surveys in the Nordic Seas or in other regions. We show that this range-dependent decay along a given propagation path was caused by attenuation through dense herring shoals forming at sunset and persisting through the evening for transmissions near the swimbladder resonance peak. OAWRS transmissions are corrected for attenuation in a manner consistent with waveguide scattering theory and simultaneous downward directed local line-transect measurements in the region in order to produce instantaneous wide-area population density maps. Corresponding measured reductions in the median sensing range over the azimuth before ambient noise limitation are shown to be theoretically predictable from waveguide scattering theory and observed population densities. Spatial-temporal inhomogeneities in wide-area herring distributions seen synoptically in OAWRS imagery show that standard sparsely spaced line-transect surveys through this region during spawning can lead to large errors in the estimated population due to spatial and temporal undersampling.},

Individual fish trajectories were obtained by target tracking methods, and average swimming velocities as a function of depth and time before and after passage of the vessel was calculated. A measure for the change in behaviour was applied, showing a significant response during and after propeller passage. The change in horizontal displacement speed is significant at all depths, while the change in vertical displacement velocity is significant at all but one layer of depth. The horizontal reaction seems to occur a bit later than the diving reaction. After the main response, a slightly higher mean horizontal displacement speed was observed for the deepest layers. This indicates a change in the fish state after being exposed to the vessel/gear.},

	abstract = {Studies have shown that pelagic predators do not overlap with their prey at small scales. However, we hypothesized that spinner dolphin foraging would be affected by the spatio-temporal dynamics of their prey at both small and large scales. A modified echosounder was used to simultaneously measure the abundance of dolphins and their prey as a function of space and time off three Hawaiian islands. Spinner dolphin abundance closely matched the abundance patterns in the boundary community both horizontally and vertically. As hypothesized, spinner dolphins followed the diel horizontal migration of their prey, rather than feeding offshore the entire night. Spinner dolphins also followed the vertical migrations of their prey and exploited the vertical areas within the boundary layer that had the highest prey density. Cooperative foraging by pairs of dolphins within large groups was evident. The geometric and density characteristics of prey patches containing dolphins indicate that dolphins may alter the characteristics of prey patches through this cooperative foraging. The overlap of Hawaiian spinner dolphins and their prey at many temporal and spatial scales, ranging from several minutes to an entire night and 20 m to several kilometers, indicates that the availability of truly synoptic data may fundamentally alter our conclusions about pelagic predator-prey interactions.},

	abstract = {Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae have adopted unique feeding strategies to take advantage of behavioral changes in their prey. However, logistical constraints have largely limited ecological analyses of these interactions. Our objectives were to (1) link humpback whale feeding behaviors to concurrent measurements of prey using scientific echo-sounders, and (2) quantify how sand lance behavior influences the feeding behaviors and foraging ecology of humpback whales. To measure, in fine detail, the 3-dimensional orientation and movement patterns of humpback whales underwater, we used a multi-sensor tag attached via suction cups (DTAG). We tested the specific hypothesis that the diel movement patterns of sand lance between bottom substrate and the water column correlates to changes between surface and bottom feeding strategies of humpback whales on Stellwagen Bank, MA. We collected over 96 h of both day- and nighttime data from 15 whales in 2006, and recorded 393 surface and 230 bottom feeding events. Individual whales exhibit both surface and bottom feeding behaviors, switching from one to the other in relation to changing light and prey conditions. Surface feeding behaviors were individually variable in their constitution but ubiquitously biased towards daylight hours, when prey was most abundant in the upper portion of the water column. Bottom feeding behavior occurred largely at night, coincident with when sand lance descend to seek refuge in the substrate. Our data provide novel insights into the behavioral ecology of humpback whales and their prey, indicating significant diel patterns in foraging behaviors concurrent with changes in prey behavior.},

Our data were collected in February 1986, during a systematic shipboard survey of the waters surrounding Bird Island, South Georgia. Predator abundance was estimated visually using strip transects, and krill abundance was simultaneously estimated using a hull-mounted echosounder. 3. We approached the difficult analytical problems associated with spatial distributions of organisms by using spatial autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis, regression models with spatial terms, and randomization tests. The randomization tests involved repeated simulations of predator distributions, and subsequent estimation of spatial association between predators and prey. 4. Pelagic birds and seals were distributed in a strikingly non-random fashion at sea near South Georgia; their distributional patterns were strongly influenced by the distribution of krill swarms. 5.

Data collected by an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler operated in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in summer were examined for evidence of fish biomass detections between 18 and 400 m. The presence of fish in waters between 1 and 30 m was explored opportunistically with a non-scientific echo sounder. Evaluation of findings was enhanced by measurements of water column properties (temperature, salinity, fluorescence and transmissivity). Relatively small shoals of fish were detected on the Chukchi shelf and eastern Chukchi shelf break, and also on the Alaskan and Canadian Beaufort shelves in the upper 20 m (T = 2-5A degrees C). Much larger shoals (putative polar cod) were detected within Atlantic Water along the Beaufort continental slope (250-350 m) and near the bottom of Barrow and Mackenzie canyons, where temperatures were above 0A degrees C. A warm-water plume of Alaska Coastal Current water with high concentrations of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish was found extending along the shelf 300 km eastward of Barrow Canyon. In contrast to the warm surface and Atlantic Water layers, very few fish were found in colder, intermediate depth Pacific-origin water between them. The large biomass of fish in the Atlantic Water along the continental slope of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas represents previously undescribed polar cod habitat. It has important implications with regard to considerations of resource development in this area as well as understanding impacts of climate change.},

QTC VIEW was used to identify acoustic changes in the properties of the seabed in the presence of buried sandeels, whilst the EK500 simultaneously recorded temporal changes in their distribution throughout the water column. Our results suggest that high densities of sandeels buried in sediment give a different acoustic signal to that of its surroundings. This integrated approach showed that sandeels had a diurnal activity pattern that was strongly, although not exclusively, associated with day length.

	abstract = {Coralline algae are one of the most important constructors of biogenic habitats. In the Mediterranean Sea, the dominant coralline algae species form crusts comprising formations known as coralligene, considered as very important fishing grounds by fishermen. Due to the destructive effect of fishing gear activities over coralligene, these formations were recently protected from the use of active benthic gears by the EU 1967/2006 Mediterranean fisheries management Regulation. However, the lack of maps and information on their distribution makes the effective application of these measures impossible. The present publication contributes to the mapping of coralligene in the southern Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean), and to the study of coralline algae formation morphology, distribution, development conditions and relation to fisheries using a combination of single-beam echo sounder, sidescan sonar, sub-bottom profiler recordings and biological and sedimentological ground-truthing techniques. The coralligene formations were recognized as two distinct acoustic signatures of localized backscatter facies distinguishable from other hard substrate reflectors at depths ranging from 55.9 to 114.0 m, but mainly between 70 and 90 m. Two types of formations were identified: minute reefs 0.5-2.5 m in height and superficial layer formations no more than 0.2 m thick over the substrate. The seismic profiles revealed a cavernous internal structure of the minute reefs and recorded their development on both hard and soft substrates. The distribution of formations was contagious, creating aggregations. The finding of superficial layer formations and coralline shreds around minute coralligene reefs indicated that the former Could be an intermediate development type between isolated small coralline pebbles, rhodoliths, and minute reefs. Regarding the development conditions, sidescan sonar imagery indicated that the optimal conditions for the establishment and development of coralligene formations are medium intensity currents. Concerning human activity over coralligene, trawl traces were recorded near but not over minute reefs and both near and crossing superficial layer type aggregations, while a submarine cable was also recorded among minute reefs. The mapping of coralligene aggregation areas is essential for the application of the EU Regulation and the protection of this important marine habitat. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Chesapeake Bay has been experiencing severe eutrophication-driven bottom hypoxia for several decades, yet the effects of hypoxia on its food webs, especially its pelagic components, remain largely enigmatic. To better understand how hypoxia influences the interaction and spatial overlap between planktivorous fishes (e.g., bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli) and their mesozooplankton prey (e.g., Acartia tonsa), we contrasted the spatial distributions of these food-web components along the Bay's entire north-south axis during spring, summer, and fall 1996,1997, and 2000, and along several cross-Bay transects during summer of these same years. Pelagic fish biomass was estimated with a surface-towed split-beam echosounder. Dissolved oxygen and mesozooplankton biomass were simultaneously quantified using a towed, undulating ScanFish sensor package. Results indicate that hypoxia can disrupt the diel vertical migration behavior of planktivorous fishes in Chesapeake Bay during summer by reducing access to bottom waters and forcing fish to reside in well-oxygenated surface or nearshore waters. In turn, reduced access to bottom waters reduces spatial overlap with mesozooplankton prey, which appear to use the hypoxic zone as a refuge. Ultimately, we discuss how these hypoxia-driven changes in behavior and spatial overlap may influence food web interactions and bay anchovy recruitment in Chesapeake Bay. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Echosounder and trawling surveys revealed that a large part of the fish biomass was sprat and small herring, while faecal analyses showed that {\textgreater} 90\% of common seal prey (by weight) were clupeoid fish. (2) During the day, clupeoids concentrated in trenches and holes more than 12 m deep. Radio-tagged seals were located regularly over these areas. At night, clupeoid shoals rose in the water column and became more dispersed. Diel changes in seal activity patterns suggest that seals fed more often during the day. (3) Prey sizes were estimated from the size of otoliths retrieved from seal feaces. Estimated sizes of clupeoids taken by seals were similar to the sizes of fish caught in trawls, even though estimates were not corrected to allow for partial digestion of otoliths. This suggests that the rapid otolith digestion rates previously reported from captive seals may have been artificially high, or that the Moray Firth seals selected fish larger than those caught in trawls.},

Sampling focused specifically on the scyphozoan Chrysaora hysoscella and the hydrozoan Aequorea aequorea, both of which occur in large numbers, are probably of major ecological importance, and physically hamper pelagic fishing and diamond extraction activities. C, hysoscella was detected predominantly at an inshore station and A. aequorea was found in greatest abundance further offshore in deeper water. Echo-sounder observations were linked directly to net catches, and relationships between catch density (number of individuals m(-3)) and nautical area scattering coefficients (SA) at each frequency were determined for both species in order to estimate target strength (TS) using the comparison method. TS for C, hysoscella (mean umbrella diameter 26.8 cm) was -51.5 dB at 18 kHz, -46.6 dB at 38 kHz and -50.1 dB at 120 kHz; for A. aequorea (mean central umbrella diameter 7.4 cm) TS was -68.1 dB at 18 kHz, -66.3 dB at 38 kHz and -68.5 dB at 120 kHz. These TS values compared favourably with previously published estimates for related species. Jellyfish were caught at high numerical densities (maxima 3 C. hysoscella per 100 m(3), 168 A. aequorea per 100 m(3)). These high densities, combined with the not unsubstantial TS at frequencies used for fisheries surveys, imply that jellyfish could potentially bias acoustic estimates of fish abundance. We suggest a simple multifrequency approach that could be used to discriminate between echoes from jellyfish and some commercially important pelagic fish in the northern Benguela ecosystem.},

The majority of the herring completed spawning within 3 d. During this period, the herring were feeding and predatory fish were present in the area. An extended cylindrical school shape prior to spawning indicated that individual herring within the school had different depth preferences, with ripe individuals descending towards the spawning substrate on the bottom while immature individuals preferred the pelagic environment for safety and feeding. As the majority of the fish matured, the school segregated vertically into a pelagic component that contracted to a tight ball and a demersal component that spread out in a flat layer on the bottom. Post-spawners seemed to return to the pelagic school. After spawning, the 2 components rejoined each other and formed a loose flake (i.e. loose, uneven layer) at the surface. Schooling fish have traditionally been considered to make 1 of 3 behavioural decisions: to stay, join or leave a school. Waiting without losing contact with the rest of the school, 'await', is suggested as a fourth option.},

	abstract = {The mesopelagic boundary community off the leeward coasts of 2 Hawaiian Islands, Oahu and Hawaii, was investigated with an echosounder modified to read directly into a laptop computer, Acoustic sampling was conducted over a total distance of 12.6 km off the Waianae coast of Oahu and 46.3 km off the Kona coast of Hawaii. The density of organisms was determined using echo energy integration, and relative abundance was determined in a way analogous to catch-per-unit-effort, The vertical range of mesopelagic organisms expanded as the mesopelagic layer rose and then compressed as it descended. The vertical range of the layer off the Kona coast was larger than that off the Waianae coast, possibly because of the greater bottom depth off Kona. Near midnight, the boundary community 3 km from the shoreline was split into 2 distinct layers, one beginning approximately 25 m from the surface and one beginning approximately 90 m from the surface. The density and the relative abundance of mesopelagic organisms were consistently higher off the Waianae coast than the Kona coast. However, the density of organisms observed in both locations was high, reaching a maximum of 1800 organisms m(-3) off Waianae and 700 organisms m(-3) off Kona. The maximum relative abundance off Waianae neared 100\%, while off Kona it never exceeded 70\%. In both locations, organisms were found within 1 km of shore, in waters much shallower than their assumed daytime habitat. The temporal patterns of relative abundance and density of organisms in waters closest to the shores of each island resembled a bell curve, with a peak in relative abundance and density around midnight. In waters further from shore, the temporal patterns in relative abundance and density had a bimodal distribution, with peaks around both 21:00 and 03:00 h. These patterns in relative abundance and density are significantly affected by the distance of the sampling location from the shoreline, but not by the depth of the sampling site. The data suggest that the organisms of the mesopelagic boundary community undergo a diel horizontal migration that is reciprocal, 1.8 km in 2 h toward shore and then the same distance in approximately the same amount of time away from shore, in addition to their well-established vertical migration. The temporal patterns of the horizontal component of the migration are predictable and are conserved between days, phases of the moon, seasons, and islands.},

The population of the myctophid Benthosema glaciale displayed diverse diel vertical migration (DVM) behaviors, including normal DVM to surface waters at night, reverse DVM in the lower part of the water column in which fish ascended to similar to 200 m at day, as well as nonmigration of some individuals. The relative prevalence of these behavioral modes varied with season. Acoustic target tracking of individuals in deep water showed that B. glaciale was conspicuously inactive and drifted back and forth with weak tidal currents, essentially acting as plankton. Swimming was largely restricted to infrequent short bouts. More active swimming occasionally occurred in the vertical direction, and then in a stepwise pattern. Potential predators in deep water were swimming at speeds of {\textless}0.5 body length s-, with maximum speeds of similar to 1 body length s(-1). These results show that submerged echo sounders provide a means of non-intrusively studying both individual and population behavior of deep-living organisms.},

The potential for, and accuracy of, direct acoustic sizing of fish was tested on fish-like targets of known dimensions and orientations. Prolate spheroids, 91–477 mm long, with and without an air-filled inclusion (simulating a fish swim-bladder), made from polyvinyl-alcohol-cryogel, were suspended in an acoustic beam and rotated while the backscattered signal was recorded. The echoes from linear frequency modulated pulses of 45−90 and 160−260 kHz with a fast and a slow amplitude modulation were pulse-compressed to provide data with a range resolution of 6.6 mm at its highest. Echoes from the target boundaries were manually identified, tracked and used to directly estimate the thickness and length of the targets. An accuracy of ±11−17 mm was achieved for targets longer than about 200 mm and thicker than about 20 mm when using the 160−260 kHz pulse. The length of the air-filled inclusion could also be estimated for the larger targets. Echoes from the slow amplitude modulation were easier to interpret than the fast amplitude modulation despite the lower range resolution, due to the lower pulse compression temporal sidelobes. The results show that remote acoustic sizing of fish is feasible and of sufficient accuracy for practical use.},

In marine systems, such spatial interactions are highly dynamic and difficult to observe, as predators, prey and resources are mobile and responsive to each other, and also since shifting vertical light gradients strongly affect the space use of visual predators and their prey. We visited a bank area in the northern Barents Sea with cold bottom waters ({\textasciitilde}1°C), and combined conventional trawl and acoustic sampling with broadband hydroacoustics to obtain long-range, fine-scale observations of interactions between cod, their planktivore prey (capelin and polar cod) and krill. We caught cod in demersal trawl hauls but could not detect them with the vessel acoustics. However, broadband acoustics mounted on a submersible probe allowed us to track individual cod, revealing that they remained mostly within 10 m of the bottom throughout the diel cycle. In the morning, cod lifted slightly from the seabed indicating feeding activity, which corresponded with more fresh prey in cod stomachs in the morning. During daylight, krill pushed towards the bottom, sharing habitat with cod, while the planktivores aggregated in pelagic schools at the cost of lost feeding opportunities, overlapping with their krill prey only during twilight hours. The diel light cycle was an important driver of the spatial movements and aggregations, and krill appear to hide from capelin among the cod near bottom, while cod take advantage of descending pelagic fish after dawn to feed with a minimum of effort.},

SSLs represent a large biomass, likely involved in the biological carbon pump and the structure of marine trophic webs. Yet, the taxonomic composition remains largely unknown for many SSLs. To investigate the challenges of SSL sampling, we performed a survey in a small study area in the Northern Bay of Biscay (France) by combining broadband and narrowband acoustics, net sampling, imagery and video recordings. In order to identify organisms contributing to the observed SSLs, we compared measured frequency spectra to forward predicted spectra derived from biological data. Furthermore, to assess the confidence in SSL characterization, we evaluated uncertainties in modeling, acoustical and biological samplings. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that SSL backscattering intensity in the Bay of Biscay can be dominated in springtime by resonant gas bearing organisms below 100 kHz, namely siphonophores and juvenile fishes and by pteropods at higher frequencies. Thus, we demonstrate the importance of broadband acoustics combined to nets, imagery and video to characterize resonant backscatterers and mixed mesozooplankton assemblages.},

Here, an objective statistical approach was used to determine if there is information available in dual channel broadband data (45–170 kHz) to allow discrimination between in situ echoes obtained from monospecific aggregations of three species (hake, Merluccius productus: anchovy, Engraulis mordax; and krill, Euphausiia pacifica) using a remotely operated vehicle. These data were used to explore the effects of processing choices on the ability to statistically classify the broadband spectra to species. This ability was affected by processing choices including the Fourier transform analysis window size, available bandwidth, and the method and scale of data averaging. The approach to normalizing the spectra and the position of individual targets in the beam, however, had little effect. Broadband volume backscatter and single target spectra were both used to successfully classify acoustic data from these species with ∼6\% greater success using volume backscatter data. Broadband data were effectively classified to species while simulated multi-frequency narrowband data were categorized at rates near chance, supporting the presumption that greater bandwidth increases the information available for the characterization and classification of biological targets.},

	abstract = {Monitoring fish populations in large, deep water bodies by conventional capture methodologies requires intensive fishing effort and often causes mass mortality of fish. Thus, it can be difficult to collect sufficient data using capture methods for understanding fine scale community dynamics associated with issues such as climate change or species invasion. Hydroacoustic monitoring is an alternative, less invasive technology that can collect higher resolution data over large temporal and spatial scales. Monitoring multiple species with hydroacoustics, however, usually requires conventional sampling to provide species level information. The ability to identify the species identity of similar-sized individuals using only hydroacoustic data would greatly expand monitoring capabilities and further reduce the need for conventional sampling. In this study, wideband hydroacoustic technology was used in a mesocosm experiment to differentiate between free swimming, similar-sized individuals of two swim-bladdered species: whitefish (Coregonus wartmanni) and stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Individual targets were identified in echograms and variation in wideband acoustic responses among individuals, across different orientations, and between species was quantified and visually examined. Random forest classification was then used to classify individual targets of known species identity, and had an accuracy of 73.4\% for the testing dataset. The results show that species can be identified with reasonable accuracy using wideband hydroacoustics. It is expected that further mesocosm and field studies will help determine capabilities and limitations for classifying additional species and monitoring fish communities. Hydroacoustic species differentiation may offer novel possibilities for fisheries managers and scientists, marking the next crucial step in non-invasive fish monitoring.},

When compared with acoustic scattering models, this response can provide insight into the type of organism measured. Here, we train the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using scattering models and use it to group target spectra (25–40 kHz) measured in the mesopelagic near the New England continental shelf break. Compared to an unsupervised approach, this creates groupings defined by their scattering physics and does not require significant tuning. The model classifies human-annotated target spectra as gas-bearing organisms (at, below, or above resonance) or fluid-like organisms with a weighted F1-score of 0.90. Class-specific F1-scores varied—the F1-score exceeded 0.89 for all gas-bearing organisms, while fluid-like organisms were classified with an F1-score of 0.73. Analysis of classified target spectra provides insight into the size and distribution of organisms in the mesopelagic and allows for the assessment of assumptions used to calculate organism abundance. Organisms with resonance peaks between 25 and 40 kHz account for 43\% of detections, but a disproportionately high fraction of volume backscatter. Results suggest gas bearing organisms account for 98.9\% of volume backscattering concurrently measured using a 38 kHz shipboard echosounder between 200 and 800 m depth.},

Hull-mounted acoustic systems (usually 38 kHz) often make assumptions on average target strength (TS) of mesopelagic fish assemblages when estimating biomass/abundance. Here, an unsupervised clustering algorithm was applied on broadband acoustic data (54–78 kHz), collected by a towed instrumented platform in the central Northeast Atlantic, to identify different mesopelagic target types based on similarity of individual TS spectra. Numerical density estimates from echo-counting showed spatial differences in vertical distribution patterns of the different target types and TS spectra data suggested that \&gt;30\% of the gas-bearing targets had high resonance frequencies (\&gt;60 kHz) with low scattering strength at 38 kHz. This conceptual study highlights the importance of separating targets into different target groups to obtain correct backscatter information and to account for all relevant scatterers when estimating average TS at 38 kHz, in order to achieve more accurate biomass/abundance estimates. It furthermore demonstrates the use of a towed broadband acoustic platform for fine-scale numerical density estimates as a complementary method to hull-mounted acoustic data to increase knowledge on mesopelagic ecosystem structure.},

Trawl and multinet biological sampling as well as photographic evidence indicate that in the study area (eastern mid-Atlantic Ocean) the majority of the gas-bearing organisms were fish. Subsequently, using a two-layer viscous-elastic spherical gas backscattering model, physical characteristics such as gas-bladder features and body flesh properties were deduced from the measured backscattering signal of individual gas-bearing fish. Acoustic techniques are non-extractive, can be used for the monitoring and quantification of marine organisms in a time- and cost-effective manner, and suit studies of the mesopelagic zone, which is logistically challenging. Vessel-mounted acoustics, widely used for epipelagic studies, has limitations for mesopelagic studies as the deep organisms are inaccessible to high-frequency (≳100 kHz) acoustic pulses transmitted from the surface due to absorption.

	abstract = {In fisheries acoustics, target strength (TS) is a key parameter in converting acoustic measurements to biological information such as biomass. Modelling is a versatile tool to estimate TS of marine organisms. For swimbladdered fish, flesh shear viscosity is one of the required parameters to correctly calculate TS around the resonance frequency, where the target scatters most strongly. Resonance of mesopelagic swimbladdered fish can occur over a range of frequencies and can be within commonly used frequencies (e.g. 18, 38, or 70 kHz). Since there is little information on flesh shear viscosity of fish, especially for mesopelagic species, their resonance can bias the biological information extracted from acoustic measurements. Here, first, the applicability of using a spherical model to estimate resonant backscattering of a generic swimbladder is investigated. Subsequently, a viscous–elastic spherical gas backscattering model is used to estimate the flesh shear viscosity of swimbladdered mesopelagic fish (most likely Cyclothone spp., Family: Gonostomatidae) from in situ broadband backscattering measurements. Finally, the effects of flesh shear viscosity on the TS of swimbladdered mesopelagic fish at 18, 38 (a widely used channel to study mesopelagic layers), and 70 kHz are examined.},

Active acoustic techniques involve producing sound and receiving signals from organisms and other water column sources, offering the benefit of high spatial and temporal resolution and, via integration into different platforms, the ability to make measurements spanning a range of spatial and temporal scales. As a consequence, a variety of questions concerning the ecology of pelagic systems lend themselves to active acoustics, ranging from organism-level investigations and physiological responses to the environment to ecosystem-level studies and climate. As technologies and data analysis methods have matured, the use of acoustics in ecological studies has grown rapidly. We explore the continued role of active acoustics in addressing questions concerning life in the ocean, highlight creative applications to key ecological themes ranging from physiology and behavior to biogeography and climate, and discuss emerging avenues where acoustics can help determine how pelagic ecosystems function.},

	doi = {10.1016/s1054-3139(03)00038-9},
	abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are unmanned submersibles that can be pre-programmed to navigate in three dimensions under water. The technological advances required for reliable deployment, mission control, performance, and recovery of AUVs have developed considerably over the past 10 years. Currently, there are several vehicles operating successfully in the offshore industries as well as in the applied and academic oceanographic sciences. This article reviews the application of AUVs to fisheries- and plankton-acoustics research. Specifications of the main AUVs currently in operation are given. Compared to traditional platforms for acoustic instruments, AUVs can sample previously impenetrable environments such as the sea surface, the deep sea, and under-sea ice. Furthermore, AUVs are typically small, quiet, and have the potential to operate at low cost and be unconstrained by the vagaries of weather. Examples of how these traits may be utilized in fisheries-acoustics science are given with reference to previous work in the North Sea and Southern Ocean and to potential future applications. Concurrent advances in multi-beam sonar technology and species identification, using multi-frequency and broadband sonars, will further enhance the utility of AUVs for fisheries acoustics. However, before many of the more prospective applications can be accomplished, advances in power-source technology are required to increase the range of operation. The paper ends by considering developments that may turn AUVs from objects sometimes perceived as science fiction into instruments used routinely to gather scientific facts.},

	abstract = {Sustainable management of fisheries resources requires quantitative knowledge and understanding of species distribution, abundance, and productivity-determining processes. Conventional sampling by physical capture is inconsistent with the spatial and temporal scales on which many of these processes occur. In contrast, acoustic observations can be obtained on spatial scales from centimetres to ocean basins, and temporal scales from seconds to seasons. The concept of marine ecosystem acoustics (MEA) is founded on the basic capability of acoustics to detect, classify, and quantify organisms and biological and physical heterogeneities in the water column. Acoustics observations integrate operational technologies, platforms, and models and can generate information by taxon at the relevant scales. The gaps between single-species assessment and ecosystem-based management, as well as between fisheries oceanography and ecology, are thereby bridged. The MEA concept combines state-of-the-art acoustic technology with advanced operational capabilities and tailored modelling integrated into a flexible tool for ecosystem research and monitoring. Case studies are presented to illustrate application of the MEA concept in quantification of biophysical coupling, patchiness of organisms, predator–prey interactions, and fish stock recruitment processes. Widespread implementation of MEA will have a large impact on marine monitoring and assessment practices and it is to be hoped that they also promote and facilitate interaction among disciplines within the marine sciences.},

Consisting of two arrays of eight transducers, the sonar uses one of the arrays as a projector and the other as a receiver. In this way, a combination of 8 × 8, or 64 beams, is constructed. Spatial resolution is approximately 2° by 2° and the range resolution is 3 cm. The sonar is capable of recording up to five images every second. The data is stored digitally in a three-dimensional matrix which can be postprocessed. Tests performed in the lab with both test targets and freshwater shrimp indicate that the system has the sensitivity and accuracy to track euphausiids in the ocean. The system was deployed at sea on an ROV (Remote Operational Vehicle) and the tracks of euphausiid sized objects were recorded.},

The new fisheries multibeam echosounder ME70: description and expected contribution to fisheries research. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 645–655. Recently, Simrad in collaboration with Ifremer developed a calibrated, multibeam, vertical echosounder (ME70) for fisheries research. We describe its capabilities and technical limitations. The ME70 has up to 45 beams with distinct frequencies in the range 70–120 kHz, spanning at most 150°. All beams are stabilized in vessel roll and pitch. It has reduced side-lobe levels, up to −70 dB (two-way) instead of the −25 dB (one-way) of conventional systems. We outline research areas for which the ME70 might provide new types of information and hence lead to novel insights. We illustrate the potential contributions with datasets collected in the English Channel and on the continental-shelf break of the Bay of Biscay. Finally, future research and developments using the new system are outlined.},

Measurements of acoustic scattering from zooplankton and oceanic microstructure using a broadband echosounder. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 379-394. In principle, measurements of high-frequency acoustic scattering from oceanic microstructure and zooplankton across a broad range of frequencies can reduce the ambiguities typically associated with the interpretation of acoustic scattering at a single frequency or a limited number of discrete narrowband frequencies. With this motivation, a high-frequency broadband scattering system has been developed for investigating zooplankton and microstructure, involving custom modifications of a commercially available system, with almost complete acoustic coverage spanning the frequency range 150-600 kHz. This frequency range spans the Rayleigh-to-geometric scattering transition for some zooplankton, as well as the diffusive roll-off in the spectrum for scattering from turbulent temperature microstructure. The system has been used to measure scattering from zooplankton and microstructure in regions of non-linear internal waves. The broadband capabilities of the system provide a continuous frequency response of the scattering over a wide frequency band, and improved range resolution and signal-to-noise ratios through pulse-compression signal-processing techniques. System specifications and calibration procedures are outlined and the system performance is assessed. The results point to the utility of high-frequency broadband scattering techniques in the detection, classification, and under certain circumstances, quantification of zooplankton and microstructure.},
